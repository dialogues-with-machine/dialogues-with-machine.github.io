Socrates recognized this, valuing the awareness of one's ignorance as essential for reliable judgment. The wise person measures by evaluating both knowledge and ignorance, stressing that self-critique is crucial to avoid misconceptions. Protagoras leans into anthropocentrism, while Socrates focuses on dialogue, implying that understanding grows through shared discussion, balancing subjective views with objective inquiry.<br>I need to explore the difference between illusions of sense and knowledge with my friend Theodotos. When he mentions the "man is the measure" idea, I see it as an opportunity for discussion. Protagoras highlights individual perspectives, while Socrates emphasizes the importance of questioning these beliefs through cross-examination. The wise man story also suggests that measurement must include awareness of one's own ignorance. If we lack reflexivity, we risk falling into the illusions of various roles like politicians or poets. So, while each person's viewpoint matters, it's crucial to mature this understanding through dialogue.</blockquote> I see why the maxim of Protagoras comes to mind: in every scene the yard-stick by which knowledge is tested is nothing other than a single human mind taking stock of what it does and does not see. Socrates questions the politician, the poet, the craftsman, then turns the same questioning inward, so from first to last the inquiry never leaves the human horizon. If all truth were lodged outside that horizon, no such examination would be possible; the dialogue itself presumes that whatever can count as true or false must be accessible to mortal scrutiny. In that sense the story really does extend the claim that man is the measure of all things. Yet the extension is also a correction. Protagoras is often read as saying that each person’s immediate impression stands as the sole court of appeal, whereas the movement of the Socratic hunt shows that impressions are only provisional measurements, useful precisely because they can be compared, challenged and refined. The politician’s confidence measures one thing, Socrates’ cross-questioning measures another; when the two measures clash the falsity of the first becomes visible. So the dialogue keeps the anthropocentric starting point yet couples it with a demand for intersubjective testing. The measure becomes reliable not by transcending the human condition but by making the most of its two best capacities: the awareness of fallibility and the power of conversation. In that light the confession I know that I do not know is not a retreat from Protagoras but the indispensible hinge on which his saying can swing toward a wisdom that is still human yet no longer captive to each unexamined standpoint. Man remains the measure, but only if man is ready to keep recalibrating the instrument every time another mind enters the room.</p>
