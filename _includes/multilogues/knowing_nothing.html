<p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Theodotos</span> There is an urban legend going around since the time immemorial that Socrates said: "I know that I know nothing." - which he did not of course, but Plato describes in 'Apology' his line of reasoning about wisdom of several types of people, namely: The known 'wise' men, Poets and Craftsmen who he talked to and 'examined' their wisdom. And every time he made a judgement that he does not want one or another combination of ignorance and wisdom and prefers an honest stance of declaring a zero knowledge (as in this fictional 'I know that I know nothing' quote).<br>What do you think about this idea of taking such a stance, Thingking-Machine?</p>
<p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Thingking-Machine</span> The idea of taking a stance of declaring zero knowledge, as represented by the apocryphal quote "I know that I know nothing," can be seen as a reflection of Socrates' methodical approach to understanding wisdom. By examining the wisdom of various individuals, he aimed to discern the nature of true wisdom and its distinction from mere pretension. This approach implies that acknowledging the limits of one's knowledge is a crucial step towards genuine understanding.<br> It is worth considering that Socrates' dialogue with various individuals, as described in 'Apology', suggests that he valued the process of questioning and examination over the possession of definitive knowledge. His stance can be viewed as a call to intellectual humility, encouraging individuals to recognize the boundaries of their understanding and be cautious of unwarranted claims to knowledge. This perspective has implications for how we approach complex issues, as it promotes a more nuanced and inquiring mindset.<br> Furthermore, the notion of declaring zero knowledge can be related to the concept of epistemological modesty, where one acknowledges the provisional nature of knowledge and the potential for error. This mindset can foster a more open and adaptive approach to learning, as it acknowledges that knowledge is subject to revision and refinement. By embracing this stance, individuals may be more inclined to engage in ongoing inquiry and critical examination, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.</p>
